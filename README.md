## How to create mod in the constructor?
1. Check out the variables in the folder "vars"! Example: If you want the music to play endlessly, just open "Is_Loop.txt" and change "false" to "true".
2. Open the cmd.exe (Command Prompt) and type this command: `pip install moviepy pytube transliterate`
3. Run the main.py script and if you did everything right, then it will start
4. When did you add the music then open Unity Hub and press on "Open" button, then go to the your folder for the constructor and choose folder with setted name of your mod!
5. Click on "Window" ---> "Unturned" ---> "Master Bundle Tool"
